## How to play

The goal of breakout is simple, you have three lives to remove every block from the screen by using your paddle to bounce the ball into
the blocks.

As you remove blocks, the game will change dependant on the number of blocks you remove and the layer of blocks you reach.

## Controls

Left Arrow / A - Move Left  
Right Arrow / D - Move Right
